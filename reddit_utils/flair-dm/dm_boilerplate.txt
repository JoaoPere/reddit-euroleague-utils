Hello u/{redditor_name},

I see you participated in r/Euroleague just now and you don't have any user flair set yet. Fancy representing your club? It's pretty easy if you have done that on other communities but we still got you if are not familiar with the process.

Learn how to do so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Euroleague/comments/hjc9bh/a_guide_on_how_to_setup_your_own_user_flair/)!

In case you are still having trouble doing it or the team you're looking for is unavailable contact us by replying to this PM or by sending a [message to the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Euroleague) with the team you wish to show on your participations within the sub.

Don't worry, we won't spam you anymore. This is the only time you will hear about this from us.

Stay active,
r/Euroleague
